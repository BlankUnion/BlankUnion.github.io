      <p>&nbsp; Hey there! My name is Connor Foley and I'm a sophomore at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Originally I was going to the University of Nevada, Reno, but due to covid hitting in full force, and none of my classes being in person I decided to move back down to Las Vegas to pursue my degree at home. I'm a graphic design major with experience in web design and programming. I've always had an interest in working with computers and over time developed a profficiency with designing websites for friends or projects that I am working on. One of the portfolios that I built for my friend even helped him get a job at a major game design studio. <br><br> &nbsp;
	  I've always been interested in Digital Media and all forms of Digital Media, and the ways you are able to incorporate all forms of media inside of Digital Media, seeing written media in blog posts (like this one!), adding audio and visual media forms through video or music files, and being able to present film and television through clips for context in posts. <br><br>&nbsp; 
      A couple of questions that I would like to look into during this semester are how do people with different learning types (ie. auditory, visual etc. ) interact with the different media types and if digital media is able to work with all types of learners in different ways as a universal means of bringing across information. I'd also like to learn about how to best convey different types of messages through digital media.
